# Efficient Access Control For NDN based IoT platform
## Abstract
Information-Centric Networking(ICN) is an emerging networking concept. Named Data
Networking (NDN)is an instance of ICN that focuses on what is the content rather than
where the host having that content. Internet of Things is todayâ€™s one of the areas where
scalability and security has an important role. Named Data Networking based IoT has
gained significance due to the feature like in-network caching. The main objective of the
research is a) to analyze why NDN-IoT is better than state-of-art protocols based on TCP/IP
as well as other protocols in NDN and, b) propose the effective access control mechanisms
for NDN-IoT
